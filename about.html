      <p>
        The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES), also known as Industrial Training is a compulsory skills training programme designed to expose and prepare students of 
        Nigerian Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education, Colleges of Technology and Colleges of Agriculture, for the industrial
        work situation they’re likely to meet after graduation.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The scheme also affords students the opportunity 
        of familiarizing and exposing themselves to the needed experience in handling equipment and machinery that are usually not available in their institution. Before the establishment of the scheme, there was a growing concern among industrialists, that graduates of institutions of 
        higher learning lacked adequate practical background studies preparatory for employment in industries. Thus, employers were of the opinion that the theoretical education in 
        higher institutions wasn’t responsive to the needs of the employers of labour.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Industrial Training Fund (I.T.F) did SIWES introduction, initiation and design in 1993 to acquaint 
        students with the skills of handling employer’s equipment and machinery. The Industrial Training Fund (I.T.F) solely funded the scheme during its formative years. 
        However, because of financial constraints, the fund withdrew from the scheme in 1978.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Federal Government, noting the significance of the 
        skills training handed the management of the scheme to both the National Universities Commission (N.U.C) and the National Board for Technical Education (N.B.T.E) in 1979. The management and implementation of the scheme was however reverted to the I.T.F by the Federal Government in November, 1984 and the administration was 
        effectively taken over by the Industrial Training Fund in July 1985, with the funding solely borne by the Federal Government.
